# School-site

Learning Management System Website for Schools

Group project for a LMS built with React. It connected to a (expired) MySQL database hosted by aws with student and 
admin login to access different functionality within the site. A lot of the content in the student/teacher sections
were dependent on the data from the databse so I've opted not to host the website onto a live server. (Code only- no Website). 

My main roles for this project:

•	Built home and login/sign up modal page using React and Material UI. 
•	Integrated modal page with database to achieve login/sign up functionality
•	Coded mobile responsive design 
•	Collaborated with team members on GitHub
